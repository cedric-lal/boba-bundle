Note that the contextAPI could have been used in order to simply story the state of the application. Redux has been use only as a technical demonstration.

Backend:

- better error management

- need a cache and a database

- For a better user experience, the application will always compare the latest package version with 3 other versions including at least 1 major version

Limitiation of the backend:

Some package cannot be bundle because webpack is missing a loader or because of some specific package error

Front end: short end;

- mock are duplicated
